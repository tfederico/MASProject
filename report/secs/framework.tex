\section{Framework}

We build our system using a Beliefs-Intentions architecture, similar to the Beliefs-Desires-Intentions one~\cite{caillou2017simple}. Intentions are future directed and trigger certain actions~\cite{multiagentsystems}. Agents can switch between intentions, that each imply a different assortment of tasks to complete. Based on the state of the environment at a specific time, stored in the beliefs and some local variables, the agent sets the most appropriate intention. This framework enables the agents to behave flexible and responsive to their environment.

The buses share the same interests: every bus wants to minimize the costs, the average traveling time of the passengers and the number of messages send. They cooperate to reach these goals, but also compete to obtain resources. Cooperation and competition are generally achieved through communication. Buses can send exchange messages that contain information or propositions.
