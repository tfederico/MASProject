\section{Framework}

We build our system using a Beliefs-Intentions architecture, similar to the Beliefs-Desires-Intentions one~\cite{caillou2017simple}. Intentions are future directed and trigger certain actions~\cite{multiagentsystems}. In fact, every agent has a set of intentions - i.e.,  a set of tasks that it wants to achieve. Based on the state of the environment at a specific time, stored in the beliefs and some local variables, the agent chooses the best intention to accomplish. This framework facilitates flexibility in generating actions, because an agent can switch between intentions depending on the state of the environment.

The fleet of buses share the same interests: every bus wants to minimize the costs, the average traveling time of the passengers and the number of messages it sends. However, there are some cases in which the agents compete between each others to obtain a resource, as we describe later. The cooperation and competition behaviour are generally achieved through communication: different agents can send messages to each others in order to express facts or ideas.
