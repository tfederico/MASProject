\section{Introduction}

Public transport is an universal subject of travellers' complaints, targeted at the waiting and travel time. Attempts of transportation companies to reduce costs often have a detrimental effect on travelling time. A network of intelligent autonomous transportation units could optimize for lowering costs and travelling time. To illustrate this, a multi-agents system is created for an intelligent bus transport in Amsterdam. The goal of this system is to transfer passengers as efficient as possible. Several methods stated in multi-agents theory \cite{intromultiagentsystems} are implemented to create this system, like communication between buses, coordination and negotiation.
