\section{Introduction}

Public transport is an universal subject of travellers' complaints, targeted at the waiting and travel time. Attempts of transportation companies to reduce costs often have a deleterious effect on travelling time. A network of intelligent autonomous transportation units could optimize the desired result, lowering costs and travelling time. To illustrate this, we created a multi-agents system for an intelligent bus transportation mechanism in Amsterdam. The goal is to transfer passengers as efficiently as possible. To create this system, we implement several methods stated in multi-agents theory~\cite{intromultiagentsystems} like communication between buses, coordination and negotiation.
